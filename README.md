Video sharing application for android

This application was made to demonstrate my ability to query and retreive a firebase database and present the variables through a
custom adapter.

The app shows videos retreived from mp4 URLs through a videoadapter on a listview.

The videos can be saved locally through the app and saved on the internal storage for offline viewing.

The database entries can be edited through the AdminLogin fragment with the user inputting new URLs which replace the
existing URL placeholder with another.
